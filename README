DeDup version 0.01
==================

This Perl module is a generic Data Deplication module.

It should work with any text based (not binary) data files, which have a character or string delimitation (currently it does not work using Regular Expressions).

The Data Duplication is using the "Last Record is the Record" option - it will internally overwrite duplicate values. Again a list of Duplications could be easily added if required;

You need tp specify a delimiter and a single key field.

Output is generated and will not touch your input files.
